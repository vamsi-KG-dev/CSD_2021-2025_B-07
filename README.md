# 📱 Smartphone Addiction Predictor  

## 🔍 About the Project  
The **Smartphone Addiction Predictor** is a web app that helps identify if a person is addicted to their smartphone based on their behavior. It uses a combination of machine learning and deep learning methods like **AdaBoost**, **XGBoost**, **Decision Trees**, **Naive Bayes**, and **CNN** for accurate predictions.

## 🎯 Goal  
- To predict whether a user is addicted to their smartphone or not.  
- Use advanced algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.  
- Provide a simple and user-friendly app for real-time predictions.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning Models**: AdaBoost, XGBoost, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes.  
- **Deep Learning**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks).  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for creating a clean and interactive interface.  
- **Backend**: Python and Flask for processing data and predictions.  

---

## 📊 How It Works  
1. The app collects user behavior details (like screen time, usage habits, etc.).  
2. It processes the data using the trained models.  
3. The result shows whether the user is addicted or not.
